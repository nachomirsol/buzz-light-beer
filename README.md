# Buzz-Light-beer

## Description
Use this app to get info from your favourite beers.

## Technology
Scripts are separated in 2 layers:
- main.js is the presentation layer where we have used jquery
- api.js is the api client where we implement the fetch method in javascript ES5 to get the json data.

Bootstrap is used for design.

## How to use it
Just open the index.html file, type for your favourite beer at the search bar and click it. A modal box with the info will be displayed. All beer info are stored in Heroku server so you may find a bit of delay while trying to search for one.
